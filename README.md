Final submission of analog hackathon
# Abstract
In this paper I have explained a CMOS based Schmitt trigger circuit which I am going to design. It consists of four MOS transistors. Three transistors are of enhancement type and one is of depletion type. For fabrication of the channel of the depletion device, with reference to conventional CMOS technology a further ion implantation stage is necessary. Whereas, the depletion device is conducting in both static states, so consumption exists, as in MOS integrated circuit.
# Reference Circuit Details
The Schmitt trigger consists of three PMOS and one NMOS transistors. The transistors Tn1 and Tn2 affect the circuit in such a way that the transfer characteristics have the shape of a hysteresis curve. Regenerative feedback is obtained using transistor Tn2 which, during the change of state, works like a source follower. With input voltage equal to zero, transistors Tn1 and Tn2 . 
# Tool Used
